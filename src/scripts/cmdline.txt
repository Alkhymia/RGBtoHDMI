# Any number of these parameters can be specified but typically you would specify:

#     - 10 comma seperated values: 0,A,B,C,D,E,F,Half,Divisor,Delay
#
# Here's a brief description of each of sampling parameter:
#     -  A Offset: set the sub-pixel sampling point for the 1st Pixel, 7th Pixel, etc.
#     -       ...
#     -  F Offset: set the sub-pixel sampling point for the 6st Pixel, 8th Pixel, etc.
#     -      Half: enables an additional half pixel delay
#     -   Divider: sets wheher the cpld samples every 6 or 8 clocks
#     -     Delay: enables an additional N-pixel delay (CPLDv2 only)
#
# The basic sampling06 and sampling7 values can be copied from the Calibration Summary screen:
#     - Select Mode 6 or Mode 7 screen (as appropriate)
#     - Type *HELP to get some text on the screen
#     - Press Auto Calibation (right button)
#     - Select: Feature Menu/Info/Calibration Summary
#     - For A..F use the six "Offset" values
#     - For Half use the "Half" value
#     - For Divider use 0 for modes 0..6 and 1 for mode 7
#     - For Delay use the "Delay" value
