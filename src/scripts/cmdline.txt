#
# These properties use a common syntax: an list of comma seperated numbers
# corresponding in order to the following parameters:
#
#                   ------- Range -------     --- Default Value ---
#                   Mode 0..6      Mode 7     Mode 0..6      Mode 7

#
# Any number of these parameters can be specified but typically you would specify:
#
#     - A single value: All Offsets (which sets Offsets A..F to that value)
#                         -- or --
#     - 8 comma seperated values: 0,A,B,C,D,E,F,Half,Delay
#
# Here's a brief description of each of sampling parameter:
#     -  A Offset: set the sub-pixel sampling point for the 1st Pixel, 7th Pixel, etc.
#     -       ...
#     -  F Offset: set the sub-pixel sampling point for the 6st Pixel, 8th Pixel, etc.
#     -      Half: enables an additional half pixel delay
#     -     Delay: enables an additional N-pixel delay (CPLDv2 only)
#
# The basic sampling06 and sampling7 values can be copied from the Calibration Summary screen:
#     - Select Mode 6 or Mode 7 screen (as appropriate)
#     - Type *HELP to get some text on the screen
#     - Press Auto Calibation (right button)
#     - Select: Feature Menu/Info/Calibration Summary
#     - For A..F use the six "Offset" values
#     - For Half use the "Half" value
#     - For Delay use the "Delay" value
#

#
# Any number of these parameters can be specified but typically you would specify:
#
#     - 6 comma seperated values: H Offset,V Offset,H Width,V Height, FB Width, FB Height
#
# Values outside of the range above may or may not work!
#
# Here's a brief description of each of sampling parameter:
#     -  H Offset: defines where to start capturing a line (units are 4-pixels)
#     -  V Offset: defines which line to start capturing (units are scan lines within the field)
#     -   H Width: defines how much of a line to capture (units are 8-pixels)
