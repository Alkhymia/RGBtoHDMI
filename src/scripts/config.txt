# Currently the RGBtoHDMI frame buffer is 672x540
#
# This is set in defs.h and is slightly larger than the Beeb's
# display to allow a bit of tolerance in where the active area
# is placed (i.e. *TV or games that play with sync position)
#
# For the display to look optimal on HDMI, it's important
# that each Beeb pixel maps exactly 1x1 or 2x2 HDMI pixels.
#
# This is achieved by carefully setting the overscan params.
#
# In SD the default overscan is 32 on all sides.
# In HD the default overscan is 48 on all sides.
#
# The overscan_xxx settings are relative to these defaults (!!!!)
#
# Or use disable_overscan=1 to eliminate all overscan
#
# So disable_overscan=1 in a HD mode is the same as
#   overscan_top=-48
#   overscan_bottom=-48
#   overscan_left=-48
#   overscan_right=-48
#
# It's also impmortant to make sure you monitor doesn't rescale. Look for
# a setting called Just Scan. On my LG 22MN43 this is only available in HD.
